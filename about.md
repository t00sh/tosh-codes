Welcome on my website !

My pseudonyme is Tosh (or t00sh/t0x0sh) and I am a french IT security student, interested by hacking since many years.

I focus principaly on cryptology (cryptanalysis of symetric and asymetric systems), memory corruption vulnerabilities and network security. As a crypto guy, I enjoy mathematics topics like algebra, arithmetics and probability.

My favorites programming languages are C, Python, Perl, OCaml, Assembly and Bash and I use Linux everyday.
